**TOE BP Measurement System**
This project aims to develop a Toe Blood Pressure (BP) Measurement System that utilizes photoplethysmography (PPG) and pressure readings to monitor and display blood pressure levels. The system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) displayed on an LCD screen and a rotary encoder for user interaction and control. An ESP (Espressif Systems) microcontroller is used for processing the data and controlling the system.

**Components**
**1. PPG Sensor:** _A photoplethysmographic sensor to measure the blood flow and provide pulse readings._
**2. Pressure Sensor:** _A pressure sensor to measure the pressure applied to the toe._
**3. ESP Microcontroller:** _An ESP microcontroller to process the sensor data and manage system operations._
**4. LCD Display:** _A graphical LCD display to show real-time blood pressure readings and system status._
**5. Rotary Encoder:** _A rotary encoder for navigating the GUI and controlling the system settings._
